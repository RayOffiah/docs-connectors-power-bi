== Verify Power BI Version

Before you proceed, verify that you have a supported version of Microsoft Power BI Desktop installed. 
The Couchbase Power BI Connector requires Power BI Desktop version March 2017 or later. 

If necessary, download Power BI Desktop from the https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=58494[Microsoft downloads] page. 

== Install the Couchbase Power BI Connector

To install the Couchbase Power BI Connector you download it, load it into Power BI, and verify installation.

=== Download the Power BI Connector

. Download the *couchbase-powerbi-connector-1.0.101.mez* file from the https://janhavi0.s3.amazonaws.com/couchbase-powerbi-connector-1.0.101.mez[Private Preview Downloads site]. 

. Move the *couchbase-powerbi-connector-1.0.101.mez* file to your `Documents\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors` directory.

=== Load the Couchbase Connector in Power BI

To load the Power BI Connector, follow the instructions for https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connector-extensibility#custom-connectors[Custom connectors] in the Microsoft documentation. 

To verify the installation, select menu:Get Data[More > Couchbase]. 
The list should now include *Couchbase Connector*.

== Install ODBC Drivers for Power BI

The connection between a Capella columnar database and Power BI requires a Couchbase ODBC driver
OpenSSL is a required dependency for the driver.

=== Install OpenSSL

. Download Win64OpenSSL_Light-1_1_1v.msi from the https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html[Shining Light Productions site].

. Install OpenSSL from the downloaded file.

=== Install the Couchbase ODBC Driver

. Download the *couchbase-odbc-0.0.0-win64.msi* driver from the https://janhavi0.s3.amazonaws.com/couchbase-odbc-0.0.0-win64.msi[Private Preview Downloads site].  

. Double-click the file to open the *Couchbase ODBC Setup Wizard*.

. Install the ODBC drivers from the downloaded file. 
This installation provides both ANSI and Unicode drivers.

[#configure-dsn]
== Configure an ODBC Data Source

You configure a data source name (DSN) for each Capella columnar database you want to use in Power BI. 

=== Prerequisites

To configure an ODBC DSN, you supply:

* The connection string for your Capella columnar instance. 

* An API key and secret to use as the DSN username and password. 

To obtain these values, follow the steps for xref:dev:use-sdk.adoc#connectionstring[getting the connection string]. 
After you copy the connection string from the Connection Information dialog, click *Generate API Key* to access a new key and its secret.

=== Configure a User DSN in Power BI

To configure the Couchbase ODBC driver as a *User DSN*, follow the instructions to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/administer-odbc-data-sources-b19f856b-5b9b-48c9-8b93-07484bfab5a7#bm2[Add an ODBC data source] in the Microsoft documentation.

You can install either *Couchbase ODBC Driver (ANSI)* or *Couchbase Unicode Driver (UNICODE)*. 
If the data contains multibyte characters, select Unicode.

When the *Create data source for Couchbase* dialog opens, you enter values as follows: 

* *Name*: Enter an identifying name for the data source.

* *Description*: Enter an optional description.

* *URL*: Enter the connection string in `couchbases://<subdomain>.<instance_id>.<instance_region_name>.aws.omnistrate.cloud:16001` format.

* *Database*: Enter the name of a Capella columnar database.

* *User*: Enter the generated API key.

* *Password*: Enter the secret for the API key.

TBD only with cert for private preview
When the *Create data source for Couchbase* dialog opens, you enter values to connect with, or without, TLS as follows:

[cols="20,~,27"]

|Field|Connect with TLS |Connect without TLS  

|Name 2+|Enter an identifying name for the data source.
|Description 2+|Enter an optional description.
|URL 2+|Leave blank.
|Host 2+|Enter 127.0.0.1 or another remote IP address.
|Port |11207 |8091
|Bucket 2+|Enter the name of a database in Capella columnar.
|SSLMode |Enter `require`. |Leave blank.
|User 2+|Enter your Couchbase username.
|Password 2+|Enter your Couchbase password.
|CertificateFile |Use escaped backslash characters to enter the local path to your certificate file, such as `C:\\Users\\first.last\...`  |Leave blank.

[#use-connector]
== Use the Couchbase Power BI Connector

Business information tools rely on data that is organized into relational databases. 
To use the Power BI connector, you must create tabular analytics views of the JSON documents in your Capella columnar collections. 
See xref:query:workbench.adoc#TAV[Save Results as a Tabular View] or xref:sqlpp:5_ddl.adoc#TAV[Tabular Views].

After you prepare tabular views and define DSNs in Power BI, you use the Couchbase Power BI Connector to load data into Power BI. 

=== Use the Connector to Add Data to Power BI

To add data from Capella columnar to Power BI, follow the instructions to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-to-data[Connect to data sources in Power BI desktop] in the Microsoft documentation.

*Couchbase Connector* appears on the menu:Get Data[] list of data sources. 
When prompted for *Username* and *Password*, supply your Capella columnar credentials. 

After you connect, a list of the tabular views in the database specified by the DSN appears. 
btn:[Load] a view to use Power BI options.
