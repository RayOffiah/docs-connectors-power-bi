The Couchbase Power BI Connector provides integration between Microsoft's Power BI interactive data visualization platform 
and either Couchbase Analytics Service (CBAS) or tabular views of your Capella columnar (currently in https://info.couchbase.com/CapellaColumnar_Private_Preview_SignUp_LP.html[private preview]) collections or query results.

TIP: For self-managed CBAS, the Power BI connector requires Couchbase Server 7.2.4 or newer.



== Verify Power BI Version

Before you proceed, verify that you have a supported version of Microsoft Power BI Desktop installed. 
The Couchbase Power BI Connector requires Power BI Desktop version March 2017 or later. 

If necessary, download Power BI Desktop from the https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=58494[Microsoft downloads] page. 
Note, this product is only available for the Microsoft Windows platform --
for other platforms, consider our xref:tableau-connector::index.adoc[Tableau connector].


== Install the Couchbase Power BI Connector

. Download `couchbase-powerbi-connector-1.0.101.mez` from https://latestbuilds.service.couchbase.com/builds/latestbuilds/couchbase-powerbi-connector/1.0/

. Move this downloaded file -- `couchbase-powerbi-connector-1.0.101.mez` --
to `Documents\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors`


=== Configure Power BI

. Open *Power BI*

. Go to *File > Options and settings > Options > Security* and tick the *(Not Recommended) Allow any extension to load without validation or warning option*

. Click `OK`

. Restart *Power BI*

=== Verify the Connector is Loaded Successfully:

. Open *Power BI*

. Go to *Get Data -> More -> Couchbase*


The Couchbase Power BI Connector is now correctly configured to work with the Power BI platform.
Next, you need to configure a connection to Couchbase Analytics or an instance of the Capella columnar database.


== ODBC and OpenSSL

The connection between a Couchbase Analytics instance (or a version of Capella columnar database -- 
currently in https://info.couchbase.com/CapellaColumnar_Private_Preview_SignUp_LP.html[private preview]) 
and Power BI requires a Couchbase ODBC driver.
OpenSSL is a required dependency for the driver.

=== Install OpenSSL

. Download Win64OpenSSL_Light-1_1_1v.msi from the https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html[Shining Light Productions site].

. Install OpenSSL from the downloaded file.

=== Install the Couchbase ODBC Driver

. Download the couchbase-odbc-0.0.0-win64.msi file from https://latestbuilds.service.couchbase.com/builds/latestbuilds/couchbase-odbc-driver/1.0[https://latestbuilds.service.couchbase.com/builds/latestbuilds/couchbase-odbc-driver/1.0]

. Double-click the file to open the *Couchbase ODBC Setup Wizard*.

. Install the ODBC drivers from the downloaded file. 
This installation provides both ANSI and Unicode drivers.


== Configure an ODBC Data Source

You configure a data source name (DSN) for each CBAS cluster or Capella columnar database you want to use in Power BI. 

=== Prerequisites

To configure an ODBC DSN, you supply:

* The connection string for your https://info.couchbase.com/CapellaColumnar_Private_Preview_SignUp_LP.html[Capella columnar instance] or self-managed CBAS nodes. 

* (For Columnar) An API key and secret to use as the DSN username and password. 

To obtain these values, follow the steps for xref:dev:use-sdk.adoc#connectionstring[getting the connection string]. 
After you copy the connection string from the Connection Information dialog, click *Generate API Key* to access a new key and its secret.

=== Configure a User DSN in Power BI

To configure the Couchbase ODBC driver as a *User DSN*, follow the instructions to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/administer-odbc-data-sources-b19f856b-5b9b-48c9-8b93-07484bfab5a7#bm2[Add an ODBC data source] in the Microsoft documentation.

You can install either *Couchbase ODBC Driver (ANSI)* or *Couchbase Unicode Driver (UNICODE)*. 
If the data contains multibyte characters, select Unicode.

When the *Create data source for Couchbase* dialog opens, you enter values as follows: 

* *Name*: Enter an identifying name for the data source.

* *Description*: Enter an optional description.

* *URL*: Enter the connection string in `couchbases://<subdomain>.<instance_id>.<instance_region_name>.aws.omnistrate.cloud:16001` format.

* *Database*: Enter the name of a Capella columnar database or CBAS instance.

* *User*: Enter the generated API key.

* *Password*: Enter the secret for the API key.

== Use the Couchbase Power BI Connector

Business information tools rely on data that is organized into relational databases. 
To use the Power BI connector, you must create tabular analytics views of the JSON documents in your Capella columnar collections. 
See xref:query:workbench.adoc#TAV[Save Results as a Tabular View] or xref:sqlpp:5_ddl.adoc#TAV[Tabular Views].
For self-managed CBAS, see xref:server:analytics:run-query.adoc#Using_analytics_workbench[the workbench docs] or 
xref:server:analytics:5a_views.adoc#tabular-analytics-views[tabular views].

After you prepare tabular views and define DSNs in Power BI, you use the Couchbase Power BI Connector to load data into Power BI. 

=== Use the Connector to Add Data to Power BI

To add data from Capella columnar to Power BI, follow the instructions to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-to-data[Connect to data sources in Power BI desktop] in the Microsoft documentation.

*Couchbase Connector* appears on the menu:Get Data[] list of data sources. 
When prompted for *Username* and *Password*, supply your Capella columnar credentials. 

After you connect, a list of the tabular views in the database specified by the DSN appears.
