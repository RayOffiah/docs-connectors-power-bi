{description}

The Couchbase Power BI Connector provides integration between Microsoft's Power BI interactive data visualization platform 
and either:

* Couchbase Analytics Service (CBAS)
+ 
TIP: For self-managed CBAS, the Power BI connector requires Couchbase Server 7.2.4 or newer.

* Tabular views of your Capella columnar collections or query results.
+
TIP: Capella columnar is currently in https://info.couchbase.com/CapellaColumnar_Private_Preview_SignUp_LP.html[private preview]. 

== Verify Power BI Version

Before you proceed, verify that you have a supported version of Microsoft Power BI Desktop installed. 
The Couchbase Power BI Connector requires Power BI Desktop version March 2017 or later. 

If necessary, download Power BI Desktop from the https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=58494[Microsoft downloads] page. 

NOTE: Power BI is only available for the Microsoft Windows platform --
for other platforms, consider our xref:tableau-connector::index.adoc[Tableau connector].


== Install the Couchbase Power BI Connector

. Download `couchbase-powerbi-connector-1.0.mez` from https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-powerbi-connector/1.0/couchbase-powerbi-connector-1.0.mez[https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-powerbi-connector/1.0/couchbase-powerbi-connector-1.0.mez] -- 
see the xref:release-notes.adoc[release notes page] for more details.

. Follow https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connector-extensibility#custom-connectors[Microsoft's guide] on configuring a custom connector.


=== Verify the Connector is Loaded Successfully:

. Open *Power BI*.

. Go to *Get Data -> More -> Couchbase Connector*


The Couchbase Power BI Connector is now correctly configured to work with the Power BI platform.

Next, you configure a connection to Couchbase Analytics or an instance of the Capella columnar database.


== ODBC and OpenSSL

The connection between a Couchbase Analytics instance or a Capella columnar database (currently in https://info.couchbase.com/CapellaColumnar_Private_Preview_SignUp_LP.html[private preview]) 
and Power BI requires a Couchbase ODBC driver.
OpenSSL is a required dependency for the driver.

=== Install OpenSSL

. Download `Win64OpenSSL_Light-1_1_1v.msi` from the https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html[Shining Light Productions site].

. Install OpenSSL from the downloaded file.

. Verify that Windows has installed SSL, and registered the path of the binary.
Open the command prompt (`cmd`), and enter the following:
+
----
openssl version
----

. If the output indicates OpenSSL is not installed, rather than returning the version that you installed, then you need to add the OpenSSL binary's path to the `env`:

.. Check the `C:\Program Files` or use `Find` to locate the SSL binary -- usually the path will be something like:
+
----
C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin
----

.. Add this path to environmental variables list, found in menu:System variables[Path].

.. Now verify that Windows has registered the path of the binary.
Once again, open the command prompt (`cmd`) -- it must be a fresh command prompt, as the earlier one will not have loaded the newly-added environmental variables -- and enter the following:
+
----
openssl version
----

=== Install the Couchbase ODBC Driver

. Download the `couchbase-odbc-1.0-win64.msi` file from https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-odbc-driver/1.0/couchbase-odbc-1.0-win64.msi[https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-odbc-driver/1.0/couchbase-odbc-1.0-win64.msi] -- see the xref:release-notes.adoc[release notes page] for more details.

. Double-click the file to open the *Couchbase ODBC Setup Wizard*.

. Install the ODBC drivers from the downloaded file. 
This installation provides both ANSI and Unicode drivers.


== Configure an ODBC Data Source

You configure a data source name (DSN) for each CBAS scope or Capella columnar database you want to use in Power BI. 

=== Prerequisites

To configure an ODBC DSN, you supply:

* The connection string for your https://info.couchbase.com/CapellaColumnar_Private_Preview_SignUp_LP.html[Capella columnar instance] or self-managed CBAS nodes. 

* (For columnar) An API key and secret to use as the DSN username and password. 
// Uncomment once docs are public:
// To obtain these values, follow the steps for xref:dev:use-sdk.adoc#connectionstring[getting the connection string]. 
To obtain these values, follow the steps in the https://preview.docs-test.couchbase.com/trial/docs-columnar/current/dev/use-sdk.html#connectionstring[columnar private preview docs].
After you copy the connection string from the Connection Information dialog, click *Generate API Key* to access a new key and its secret.

=== Configure a User DSN in Power BI

To configure the Couchbase ODBC driver as a *User DSN*, follow the instructions to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/administer-odbc-data-sources-b19f856b-5b9b-48c9-8b93-07484bfab5a7#bm2[Add an ODBC data source] in the Microsoft documentation.

You can install either *Couchbase ODBC Driver (ANSI)* or *Couchbase Unicode Driver (UNICODE)*. 
If the data contains multibyte characters, select Unicode.

[IMPORTANT]
Be careful to use the *ODBC Data Source Administrator (64 bit)* -- there is an *ODBC Data Source Administrator (32 bit)* available, but this will not work with the connector.

When the *Create data source for Couchbase* dialog opens,
select *Capella Columnar* or (for CBAS) *Couchbase Analytics* and enter values as follows: 



[{tabs}] 
==== 
Couchbase Analytics Service (CBAS)::
+
--
* *Name*: Enter an identifying name for the data source.

* *Description*: Enter an optional description.

* *Host*: Enter the IP address of Data (KV) node in Couchbase cluster.

* *Port*: `11207`  

* *Scope*: Name of the scope from which the data is being extracted.
If a two part scope -- such as `travel-sample.inventory` -- then the two parts must be separated by a `/` -- `travel-sample/inventory`.

* *SSLMode*: `require`

* *User*: You can use the Administrator user set up during installation for testing purposes, but a user restricted to only CBAS permissions --
xref:server:learn:security/roles.adoc#cluster-admin[Cluster Admin Role] -- should be used for deployment.

* *Password*: Enter the cluster password.

* *CertificateFile Path*: `path\\to\\certificateFile.pem`

Note, for non-TLS (not recommended for production) the port number is `8091`, the *SSLMode* field left empty, and a *CertificateFile Path* is not entered.
--

Capella columnar (Preview)::
+ 
-- 
* *Name*: Enter an identifying name for the data source.

* *Description*: Enter an optional description.

* *URL*: Enter the connection string in `couchbases://<subdomain>.<instance_id>.<instance_region_name>.aws.omnistrate.cloud:16001` format.

* *Database*: Enter the name of a Capella columnar database.

* *User*: Enter the generated API key.

* *Password*: Enter the secret for the API key.

== Use the Couchbase Power BI Connector

Business information tools rely on data that is organized into relational databases. 
To use the Power BI connector, you must create tabular analytics views of your JSON documents. 
// For Capella columnar, see xref:query:workbench.adoc#TAV[Save Results as a Tabular View] or xref:sqlpp:5_ddl.adoc#TAV[Tabular Views].
For self-managed CBAS, see xref:server:analytics:run-query.adoc#Using_analytics_workbench[the workbench docs] or 
xref:server:analytics:5a_views.adoc#tabular-analytics-views[tabular views].

After you prepare tabular views and define DSNs in Power BI, you use the Couchbase Power BI Connector to load data into Power BI. 

=== Use the Connector to Add Data to Power BI

To add data from Capella columnar or CBAS to Power BI, follow the instructions to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-to-data[Connect to data sources in Power BI desktop] in the Microsoft documentation.

*Couchbase Connector* appears on the menu:Get Data[] list of data sources. 
When prompted for *Username* and *Password*, supply your Capella columnar or CBAS credentials. 

After you connect, a list of the tabular views in the database specified by the DSN appears. 
btn:[Load] a view to use Power BI options.
